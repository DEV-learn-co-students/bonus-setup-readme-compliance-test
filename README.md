## Supporting Software

There are a bunch of tools that we find invaluable as a developer.

### Protect your Eyes!

We love [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/)! f.lux adjusts your screen's brightness depending on the lighting and the time of day / sun level in the sky, for ease on your eyes and to help you sleep. Play around with the settings. It's subtle, but makes a **huge** difference, especially if you're working late on your computer.

### A Launcher

You should have a quick launcher so that you can run applications and arbitrary commands through a keyboard shortcut.

[Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com/) - This is my favorite, but it costs money to unlock the very required power features. But I use this around 92 times a day. Plus it comes with a clipboard history. There are lots of power user guides for all this software.

[Quicksilver](http://qsapp.com/) - tried and true and free and awesome. but so old.

[Launchbar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) - People love it, I've never used it, and I think it costs money.

### Clipboard History

If you do not have a clipboard history enabled...well, I mean, that's just crazy. The one in Alfred is awesome. Others include:

[Collective](http://www.generation-loss.com/) - Looks awesome, super cheap ($2), have never used it.

[Jumpcut](http://jumpcut.sourceforge.net/) - Free but old.

[ClipMenu](http://www.clipmenu.com/) - Free.


### Documentation

[Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) - A comprehensive documentation browser. It's awesome, will save you hours in googling. Costs money, but worth it.

### Git Visualizers

[Github OS X](http://mac.github.com/) - Worth having, but honestly, I've never used it.

[SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) - Super heavy git gui that's free and pretty good.

[GitX (L)](http://gitx.laullon.com/) - A well maintained fork of GitX

### Window Management
[Spectacle](http://spectacleapp.com/) - Free and open source
[Breeze](http://www.autumnapps.com/breeze/) - My favorite.
